# SIMPLE PRODUCT PRICE DISPLAY FIX

## Problem

Simple products were showing "Select variant to see price" instead of displaying the actual price immediately, even though simple products have default variants.

## Root Cause

The `addProductToOrder` function was only loading variants for configurable products, but simple products also have default variants that need to be loaded to display price information.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced `addProductToOrder` Function

-   Added logic to differentiate between configurable and simple products
-   For simple products: Show "Loading price..." initially
-   For configurable products: Show "Select variant to see price"

### 2. New Function: `loadSimpleProductVariant`

-   Fetches the default variant for simple products
-   Automatically selects the default variant
-   Updates price display immediately
-   Sets stock limits for quantity input
-   Creates hidden variant select for compatibility with existing pricing logic

### 3. Improved User Experience

-   Simple products now show price immediately upon addition
-   No need to select variants for simple products
-   Maintains compatibility with existing pricing calculation system
-   Proper stock validation for simple products

## Technical Implementation

### API Call

```javascript
fetch(`/admin/products/${productId}/all-variants`);
```

### Default Variant Selection

```javascript
// Creates hidden select with default variant
const variantSelect = $(`.variant-select[data-item-index="${itemIndex}"]`);
variantSelect.val(defaultVariant.id);
```

### Price Display Update

```javascript
const priceFormatted = new Intl.NumberFormat("id-ID", {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "IDR",
    minimumFractionDigits: 0,
}).format(defaultVariant.price);
```

## Result

✅ Simple products now display price immediately  
✅ Pricing summary works correctly for simple products  
✅ Stock validation works for simple products  
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
