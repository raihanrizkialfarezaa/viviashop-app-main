# 🎉 ADMIN PRINT SERVICE VIEW FIX - COMPLETED

## ✅ PROBLEM RESOLVED

**Original Error**:

```
InvalidArgumentException: View [admin.layout.master] not found.
```

**URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/print-service`

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue Identified

The admin print service views were trying to extend a non-existent layout:

-   `@extends('admin.layout.master')` ← **This layout doesn't exist**

### Investigation Results

-   ✅ All other admin views use `@extends('layouts.app')`
-   ✅ `layouts.app.blade.php` exists and works properly
-   ❌ `admin.layout.master.blade.php` does not exist
-   ❌ No `admin/layout/` directory found

## 🛠️ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Files Updated

**1. resources/views/admin/print-service/index.blade.php**

```diff
- @extends('admin.layout.master')
+ @extends('layouts.app')
```

**2. resources/views/admin/print-service/queue.blade.php**

```diff
- @extends('admin.layout.master')
+ @extends('layouts.app')
```

### Why This Fix Works

-   `layouts.app` is the standard layout used by all other admin views
-   It provides the necessary HTML structure, CSS, and JavaScript
-   Maintains consistency with the rest of the admin interface
